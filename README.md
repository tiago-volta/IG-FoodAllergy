# Food Allergy Implementation Guide

This Implementation Guide (IG) was created as a **test project** for the purpose of learning and experimenting with the creation of FHIR resources related to food allergies — specifically, **peanut allergy**.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was **educational**. It served as a hands-on exercise to explore and understand:

- FHIR Shorthand (FSH) syntax
- The use of **SUSHI** (SUSHI Unshortens ShortHand Inputs)
- Creation of `AllergyIntolerance` examples
- Publishing an IG using HL7's IG Publisher

## Contents

This IG includes:

- An example instance of `MyPeanutAllergy` using FSH
- A simple profile extending `FoodAllergy`
- Use of standard terminologies like SNOMED CT and HL7 CodeSystems

## Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **This guide is not intended for clinical or production use.**  
> It was created solely for **learning purposes**, as part of a study on FHIR interoperability tools and workflows.
